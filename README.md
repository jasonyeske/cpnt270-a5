### Design Concept Notes

- I wanted the site to be simple, and easy to navigate
- I looked at different sports sites, and used some of their examples to create my own project
    - [TSN](https://www.tsn.ca/)
    - [The Score](https://www.thescore.com/)
    - [NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/)

- I went with a red(ish) theme because red is my favourite colour

### Main Page
- I made two different sized cards
    - The big cards are for the important news
    - The smaller cards are not as important
- I want the user to know right off the bat what is most important happening in the sports world when they enter the site
- I rounded the images just to make it look nicer in the cards
- When hovering a card
    - I wanted the user to know it would send them to a new page, so i made each card larger for a zoom effect

### News Page
- These pages I tried to keep simple
- I wanted the author to have the choice of layout on the page
    - Big image for less text posts
    - Smaller image for more text posts
- I also wanted the author to be able to link to their social media, so I added a twitter button
- Home button in top right to redirect back to home page

### Nav Bar
- I never completed the nav bar
    - Want when hovering a sport for it to drop down
    - Display different things
        - News
        - Scores 
        - Trades
        - Standings
- The hamburger menu would also drop down, displaying the not as huge sports
    - Golf
    - Tennis
    - Racing
